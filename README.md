# mushroom-classification
Final project – mushroom classification using supervised ML

## Dataset
UCI Mushroom Dataset.

## Approach
Several supervised learning models were trained and compared after data preprocessing and parameter tuning. Those models are:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

## Result
The best-performing model achieved up to 100% accuracy on the dataset.

## Application
A simple application is included to demonstrate model predictions.
